      <h1>You Died How Many Times?</h1>
      <p>A fun way to keep track of boss deaths</p>
      <p>
        I made this counter tool so that you can keep track of your deaths when
        fighting tough bosses. I wanted to use Elden Ring as a starter point, to
        allow the user a fun way to keep track of personal deaths(per character
        or per profile) as well as community deaths.
      </p>
      <p>
        Search for and select the boss you are currently fighting, and use the
        counter for every death that occurs. Select the'enemy felled' button
        once you have...well..Felled the Enemy
